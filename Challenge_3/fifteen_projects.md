## 15 projects in 15 days
One of my favourite anecdotes about creative work is from David Bayles and Ted Orland's book, Art & Fear. It is titled: `Quantity Leads to quality` but I like to call it `Quantity Trumps Quality`. I recently found out the story is indeed true but retold to allow for some literary license. It goes like this:

`[A] ceramics teacher announced on opening day that he was dividing the class into two groups. All those on the left side of the studio, he said, would be graded solely on the quantity of work they produced, all those on the right solely on its quality. His procedure was simple: on the final day of class he would bring in his bathroom scales and weigh the work of the “quantity” group: fifty pounds of pots rated an “A”, forty pounds a “B”, and so on. Those being graded on “quality”, however, needed to produce only one pot — albeit a perfect one — to get an “A”. Well, came grading time and a curious fact emerged: the works of highest quality were all produced by the group being graded for quantity. It seems that while the “quantity” group was busily churning out piles of work – and learning from their mistakes — the “quality” group had sat theorizing about perfection, and in the end had little more to show for their efforts than grandiose theories and a pile of dead clay.`

The moral of this story is that consistent small improvements are better than one big change. Hence, this project.

I decided to have this project to encourage continuous and consistent improvement. I sincerely hope you can persist long enough to see returns on your commitments. Thanks

Happy coding!
